- Implement a multi-page website structure using HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Create a navigation bar (`<nav>`) with links (`<a>`) to different sections and pages within the portfolio.

2. Home Page (Index):
- Feature a hero section with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.
- Include a brief introduction section highlighting skills and expertise.
- Implement social media links using icons or buttons.

3. About Me Page:
- Display detailed information about yourself, including a bio, education, work experience, and interests.
- Utilize appropriate text formatting tags, headings, and lists to organize content.

4. Projects Page:
- Showcase your projects using a table layout with images and project descriptions.
- Implement links to project details or external project pages.

5. Skills and Expertise Page:
- Create a section that lists your technical skills, expertise, certifications, or achievements using appropriate HTML elements (lists, tables).

6. Contact Page:
- Include a contact form (`<form>`) with fields for name, email, message, and a submit button.
- Display social media links or additional contact information.
- Embed an iframe (`<iframe>`) with a video or map from an external source.

7. Multimedia Integration:
- Incorporate multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio (if relevant to showcase work or skills) using `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` elements.
- Ensure all multimedia content includes appropriate alternative text for accessibility.

8. Interactivity and Accessibility:
- Ensure the website is accessible by using proper semantic HTML, meaningful labels, and ARIA attributes.
