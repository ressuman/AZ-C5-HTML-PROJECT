# AZ-C5-HTML-PROJECT

## HTML Project: Portfolio Website
The objective is to design and develop an interactive portfolio website that showcases your skills, projects, and accomplishments. The website will incorporate various HTML elements, emphasizing accessibility, multimedia integration, and interactivity.

### Project Components
1. Page Structure and Navigation:
- I implemented a multi-page website structure using HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- I also created a navigation bar (`<nav>`) with links (`<a>`) to different sections and pages within the portfolio.

2. Home Page (Index):
- I featured a hero section with a welcome message and a call-to-action button.
- I included a brief introduction section highlighting skills and expertise.
- I then implemented social media links using icons or buttons.

3. About Me Page:
- I displayed detailed information about myself, including a bio, education, work experience, and interests.
- Furthermore, I utilized appropriate text formatting tags, headings, and lists to organize my contents.

4. Projects Page:
- I showcased my projects using a table layout with images and project descriptions and implemented links to project details or external project pages.

5. Skills and Expertise Page:
- I also created a section that lists my technical skills, expertise, certifications, or achievements using appropriate HTML elements (lists, tables).

6. Contact Page:
- In the contact page, I included a contact form (`<form>`) with fields for name, email, message, and a submit button.
- I also displayed social media links or additional contact information.
- I also embeded an iframe (`<iframe>`) with a video or map from an external source.

7. Multimedia Integration Page:
- Along the line, I incorporated multimedia elements such as images, videos, and audio (if relevant to showcase work or skills) using `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>` elements in the multimedia integration page.
- I then made sure that all multimedia contents included appropriate alternative text for accessibility.

8. Interactivity and Accessibility:
- More importantly, I ensured that the website is accessible by all by using proper semantic HTML, meaningful labels, and ARIA attributes.

9. File Paths and Project Structure:
- I organized project files in a structured folder hierarchy.
- Also used relative paths to link resources (images, multimedia files) and separate CSS or JavaScript files (if any).
